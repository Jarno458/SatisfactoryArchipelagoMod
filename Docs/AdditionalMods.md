# Additional Mods

It is possible to use other Satisfactory mods in tandem with the Archipelago Satisfactory mod.
However, no guarantee is made that any mods except the "Certified Compatible Mods" listed below will work correctly,
especially if they affect game progression, recipes, or add unlocks to base-game technologies.

Content added by unaffiliated mods may end up inaccessible based on your chosen slot settings,
for example, its milestones could be in a tier that is after your goal.
You may be able to write patches using [ContentLib](https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentLib)
to adjust other mods to work with your slot settings,
but doing so is out of the scope of this guide.

Use unaffiliated mods at your own risk, support will not be offered.

## Dependency Mods

The following mods are **required dependencies** of the Archipelago mod and **will automatically be installed for you**
when you install it using the Satisfactory Mod Manager:

- [ContentLib](https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentLib) - Runtime content generation.
- [Free Samples](https://ficsit.app/mod/FreeSamples) - Used to implement the Free Samples options. Even if you don't have this game option enabled, the mod will still be present, but its functionality will be disabled.
- [MAM Enhancer](https://ficsit.app/mod/MAMTips) - Allows viewing MAM research nodes in detail. Enables you to hover over the items/unlocks of a node to see more info, especially important when their names get long.
- [FixClientResourceSinkPoints](https://ficsit.app/mod/FixClientResourceSinkPoints) - Fixes a bug where AWESOME Sink point values aren't loaded properly on multiplayer clients.
- [Hover Pack Fuse Reminder](https://ficsit.app/mod/HoverpackFuseReminder) - Randomization means pioneers can get access to hoverpacks while their power grids can't yet handle the power draw. This mod reminds the player if they're wearing a hoverpack when resetting fuses.

## Certified Compatible Mods

The following mods are known to work with Archipelago:

- [TFIT - FICSIT Information Tool](https://ficsit.app/mod/TFIT) - View how many Sink Points items are worth and how points-profitable recipes are. Helpful for the AWESOME Sink goals.
- [Faster Manual Crafting Redux](https://ficsit.app/mod/FasterManualCraftingRedux) - Reduce the early game manual crafting grind with a manual crafting speed that ramps up as you craft larger batches at once.

## Community Tested Mods

The following mods have been used successfully by other players but have not been thoroughly tested with Archipelago:

### Extended Randomization

- [Resource Roulette](https://ficsit.app/mod/ResourceRoulette) - Randomize the location of resource nodes
- [Random Start Location](https://ficsit.app/mod/RandomStart) - The game already spawns you in a random position within your chosen start location. This mod lets you start in a truly random location. Be prepared to start a new save if it spawns you in an unfortunate location.

### Quality of Life

- [Infinite Zoop](https://ficsit.app/mod/InfiniteZoop) - Adds a research tree in the MAM where you can improve your Zoop capacity. Also enables multi-row & column Wall and Foundation construction.
- [Doggo Transportation](https://ficsit.app/mod/DoggoTransportation) - Easily relocate tamed Lizard Doggos. They can provide some fun out-of-logic resources.

### New Content

- [Refined Power](https://ficsit.app/mod/RefinedPower) - Additional power production options and processing chains. Its progression is not randomized at all.
- [Small Storage Containers](https://ficsit.app/mod/SmallStorage)
